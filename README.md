# ENSv2Marketplace

## About
ENSv2Marketplace is part of the **BuyETHAddress** vision — building one of the most utility-driven ENS portfolios in Web3. With over 2,000 domains focused on real-world use cases, this project is designed to showcase, lease, and expand the role of ENS in digital identity.



- **Leasing with Smart Contracts**: Allow businesses and developers to rent ENS names securely without needing to purchase outright.  
- **Utility-Driven Focus**: Every name is chosen for real-world application in Web3, DeFi, AI, and digital identity.  

This philosophy ensures BuyETHAddress is more than a portfolio — it’s a platform for adoption, growth, and long-term value in the ENS ecosystem.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1: Portfolio Showcase**  
  Organize and present 2,000+ ENS names by category (DeFi, AI, staking, finance, identity).  

- **Phase 2: Leasing Model**  
  Wait for namechain to launch
  change all names over to ensv2 namehain

- **Phase 3: Community & Events**  
   Implement new features from ENS v2 (coming in 2026).  
  Position BuyETHAddress as a leader in utility-driven ENS adoption.

# ENSv2 Marketplace™
### The Authoritative Real World Utility ENS Domain Portfolio

**[ensv2marketplace.com](https://www.ensv2marketplace.com)** | Built by the BuyETHAddress vision

---

## What This Is

ENSv2 Marketplace is the first ENS domain portfolio built around a formal ontology and taxonomy — a structured classification system that organizes 2,100+ .eth names into 30 categories and 275 subcategories mapped to real-world industries, protocol primitives, and infrastructure verticals.

Every name is chosen for real-world utility across Web3, DeFi, AI infrastructure, digital identity, and enterprise applications. No emojis. No speculation. Infrastructure only.

## The ENS Ontology

The **[ENS Ontology](https://www.ensv2marketplace.com/ens-ontology.html)** is the first published, structured classification system for ENS domain names.

- **30 top-level categories** spanning AI, blockchain infrastructure, identity, DeFi, compliance, DePIN, and more
- **275 subcategories** — each mapped to a real-world industry or protocol function
- **2,100+ domains classified** — every name assigned deterministically, not subjectively
- **Machine-readable semantic layer** for AI agents, protocol routing, and automated systems

The ontology is the semantic backbone of the marketplace. It powers discovery, pricing, bundling, agent routing, and protocol classification across the entire ENS namespace.

### Category Clusters

| Cluster | Categories |
|---|---|
| Core Protocol Infrastructure | AI & Agents, Blockchain Infrastructure, Developer Tools, Smart Contracts, Restaking, Cross-chain |
| Identity, Access & Compliance | Identity & Credentials, Privacy & ZK, Enterprise & Compliance, Healthcare |
| Finance, DeFi & Risk | Payments & DeFi, Marketplaces, Finance & Risk, Real-World Assets |
| Data, AI & Emerging Tech | Data & Oracles, Experimental & Emerging, AI Safety, Space & Deep Tech |
| Enterprise & Real World | SaaS & Platforms, Governance, Energy & IoT, DePIN, Supply Chain |
| Consumer & Community | Social, Gaming, Media, Education, Lifestyle, Consumer Web3 |

## The ENS Taxonomy

The **[30-Category, 275-Subcategory Taxonomy](https://www.ensv2marketplace.com/pricing-guide.html)** is the classification backbone of the portfolio.

Each subcategory defines a specific function within a vertical. Domain assignment is deterministic — driven by what the name does, not what it sounds like.

### The Identity Chain — Semantic Relationships

One of the most important structural patterns in the taxonomy is the identity-to-policy chain:

```
Identity → Auth → AuthZ → Access → Permission → Policy
```

- **Identity** — Who you are (`federal-id.eth`, `national-id.eth`, `stateid.eth`)
- **Auth** — Prove it (`authsystem.eth`, `authgateway.eth`)
- **AuthZ** — What you can do (`authzengine.eth`, `permissionregistry.eth`)
- **Access** — Open the door (`accessorchestrator.eth`, `accessgateway.eth`)
- **Permission** — Rules applied (`permissionledger.eth`, `policyengine.eth`)
- **Policy** — Governance layer (`compliancepolicy.eth`, `auditengine.eth`)

## ENS Pricing Guide

The **[ENS Pricing Guide](https://www.ensv2marketplace.com/pricing-guide.html)** is a complete 15-tier scoring framework for valuing any ENS domain.

### The 5 Evaluation Questions

| # | Question | YES | NO |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Does this name define a category or vertical? | Start at $9k+ list | Start lower |
| 2 | Would a serious enterprise or protocol pay for this identity? | Add commercial premium | Keep in utility range |
| 3 | Can this name power subdomains at scale? | Lease value multiplies | Value in name only |
| 4 | Is this tied to an active narrative (AI, ZK, RWA, ENSv2)? | Add narrative premium | Stable pricing |
| 5 | Could someone replace this name and lose nothing? | Do not overprice | Price irreplaceability |

### Pricing Tiers (Summary)

| ETH Range | Annual Lease | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00 – 0.99 ETH | $50 – $100/yr | Utility / Novelty |
| 1.00 – 4.99 ETH | $200 – $500/yr | Protocol Infrastructure |
| 5.00 – 9.99 ETH | $600 – $1,000/yr | Enterprise Grade |
| 10.00 – 14.99 ETH | $1,200 – $1,500/yr | Ecosystem Level |
| 15.00+ ETH | $2,500 – $10,000+/yr | Category Monopoly |

## What ENSv2 Changes

ENSv2 deploys exclusively on **Ethereum Layer 1** — Namechain (L2) was canceled February 2026.

- Gas costs dropped 99% — from ~$5 to under $0.05 per registration
- Each .eth name gets its own smart contract registry
- Subdomain leasing is viable today, not someday
- No bridging, no external gateways, no L2 trust assumptions
- Names scoring 7+ are subdomain infrastructure plays right now

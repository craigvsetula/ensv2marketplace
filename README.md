# ENS v2 Marketplace

## About
ENS v2 Marketplace is part of the **BuyETHAddress** vision — building one of the most utility-driven ENS portfolios in Web3. With over 1,300 domains focused on real-world use cases, this project is designed to showcase, lease, and expand the role of ENS in digital identity.

## Philosophy
Our mission is to unlock the full utility of ENS domains through innovative marketplace features:

- **Leasing with Smart Contracts**: Allow businesses and developers to rent ENS names securely without needing to purchase outright.  
- **Auctions**: Transparent bidding systems to maximize fair value discovery for premium domains.  
- **Bundle Listings**: Group related ENS names into packages for startups, DAOs, and enterprises.  
- **Utility-Driven Focus**: Every name is chosen for real-world application in Web3, DeFi, AI, and digital identity.  

This philosophy ensures BuyETHAddress is more than a portfolio — it’s a platform for adoption, growth, and long-term value in the ENS ecosystem.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1: Portfolio Showcase**  
  Organize and present 1,300+ ENS names by category (DeFi, AI, staking, finance, identity).  

- **Phase 2: Leasing Model**  
  Develop smart contracts for leasing ENS names.  
  Create a dashboard for businesses and developers to rent domains securely.  

- **Phase 3: Community & Events**  
  Launch promotional campaigns tied to Ethereum events (e.g., Ethereum World Fair).  
  Expand visibility through Discord, Reddit, and other Web3 communities.  

- **Phase 4: ENS v2 Integration**  
  Implement new features from ENS v2 (coming in 2025).  
  Position BuyETHAddress as a leader in utility-driven ENS adoption.

# ENSv2Marketplace

## About
ENSv2Marketplace is part of the **BuyETHAddress** vision — building one of the most utility-driven ENS portfolios in Web3. With over 2,000 domains focused on real-world use cases, this project is designed to showcase, lease, and expand the role of ENS in digital identity.

- **Leasing with Smart Contracts**: Allow businesses and developers to rent ENS names securely without needing to purchase outright.  
- **Utility-Driven Focus**: Every name is chosen for real-world application in Web3, DeFi, AI, and digital identity.  

This philosophy ensures BuyETHAddress is more than a portfolio — it’s a platform for adoption, growth, and long-term value in the ENS ecosystem.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1: Portfolio Showcase**  
  Organize and present 2,000+ ENS names by category (DeFi, AI, staking, finance, identity).  

- **Phase 2: Leasing Model**  
  Wait for ENSV2 to launch
  change all names over to ensv2 

- **Phase 3: Community & Events**  
   Implement new features from ENS v2 (coming in 2026).  
  Position ensv2marketplace as a leader in utility-driven ENS adoption.
   
**ENS Name Pricing Guide**
**How to Determine the Right Price for Any ENS Name**

**How to Use This Guide**
Pricing an ENS name is not guesswork — it follows a logic based on what the name does, who needs it, and how much leverage it gives the person who controls it. This guide gives you a practical decision framework first, then the complete pricing chart. Work through the questions in order and you will land in the right tier every time.
**
**Step 1 — Ask These 5 Questions****
Before you look at any price range, answer these five questions about the name. Each one adds or removes value. Be honest — the market will be.

#	Question	YES means...	NO means...
**1**	Does this name define a category or vertical?	✅ YES → Start at $9k+ list. This name IS the infrastructure.	❌ NO → Start lower. It supports something, it doesn't define it.
**2**	Would a serious enterprise or protocol pay to own this identity?	✅ YES → Add commercial premium. Move up at least one tier.	❌ NO → Keep it in the utility range. It has use but not enterprise pull.
**3**	Can this name power subdomains at scale?	✅ YES → Lease value multiplies. Flag it as a subdomain platform play.	❌ NO → Value is in the name itself only. Price on direct use.
**4**	Is this name tied to an active or emerging narrative (AI, ZK, RWA, ENSv2)?	✅ YES → Add narrative premium. Hot narratives move faster and higher.	❌ NO → Stable pricing. Good utility names hold value regardless.
**5**	Could someone replace this name with something else and lose nothing?	✅ YES → If YES — it is replaceable. Do not overprice it.	❌ NO → If NO — it is irreplaceable. Price it accordingly.


**Step 2 — Score the name****
After answering the five questions, give the name a score from 1 to 10 using the table below. This score maps directly to the pricing tier in Step 3.

Score	What this name is
1–2	Novelty or experimental. No real commercial use case. Hard to explain why someone would lease it.
3–4	Useful tool or service name. Has a real function but doesn't define a category or control a vertical.
5–6	Solid utility name. Works for a product, protocol, or platform. Has commercial application in one vertical.
7–8	Premium multi-vertical or category-adjacent name. Serious builders would want this. Strong subdomain potential.
9	Category-defining name. This IS the default name for something important. Enterprise and protocol grade.
10	Top 1% infrastructure primitive. Irreplaceable. Defines the entire vertical. Examples: orchestrator, aggregator, executor, gateway, national-id.


**Step 3 — Apply the Pricing Chart**
Match your score to the list price range and annual lease. These ranges reflect the real commercial value of the name, not just its novelty. The lease price is the annual rate for a subdomain or name lease. The list price is the outright sale price in ETH equivalent.

List Price (ETH)	Annual Lease	Strategic Value & Use Case
0.00 – 0.49	$50/year	Utility with no strategic leverage. Tools, novelty names, experimental concepts. They don't control or define anything.
0.50 – 0.99	$100/year	Business-level utility. Supports a product, service, or small brand. SMB tools, service names, mid-tier suites. Commercial use but doesn't define a category.
1.00 – 1.99	$200/year	Foundational infrastructure. Anchors a product or protocol. Validators, networks, AI platforms, DeFi primitives. The base layer of a system.
2.00 – 2.99	$300/year	Protocol-level infrastructure. Powers agents, registries, or network utilities. Enables multi-user or multi-system functionality.
3.00 – 3.99	$400/year	Registry-grade names. Can define a category or index. Indices, registries, platform utilities. Can become the official source for something.
4.00 – 4.99	$500/year	Enterprise-grade platforms. Anchors a serious business or protocol. Agentic systems, enterprise platforms, DeFi infrastructure.
5.00 – 5.99	$600/year	Advanced agentic infrastructure. Powers AI systems, validators, or premium suites. Used by builders who need reliability and authority.
6.00 – 6.99	$700/year	High-value AI and agent systems. Used by serious builders. Advanced AI infrastructure, agent systems, enterprise suites. Direct commercial application.
7.00 – 7.99	$800/year	Premium mixed-vertical assets. Fits multiple high-value categories. Agents, suites, DeFi infrastructure, multi-category utilities. Broad commercial potential.
8.00 – 8.99	$900/year	Premium category infrastructure. Defines a vertical. Enterprise systems, category utilities. The default name for a category.
9.00 – 9.99	$1,000/year	Enterprise platforms and high-value suites. Advanced AI utilities, DeFi platforms, category-defining brands. Can anchor a company or protocol.
10.00 – 11.99	$1,200/year	Premium AI and DeFi infrastructure. Numeric category brands, platform utilities, enterprise systems. Long-term commercial value.
12.00 – 14.99	$1,500/year	Ecosystem-level assets. Full suites, registries, complete ecosystems. Near-monopoly positioning in a vertical.
15.00+	$2,500 – $10,000+/year	Top 1% — Category monopolies and primitives. Orchestrator, router, aggregator, executor, compliance and identity primitives. Irreplaceable. They define the entire vertical. They are infrastructure.



**What ENSv2 Changes About Subdomain Leasing**
ENSv2 moves ENS to Layer 2, dramatically reducing gas costs for subdomain creation and transfer. This changes the economics of every name in this portfolio:

•Each .eth parent name gets its own smart contract registry, enabling true subdomain ownership with flexible terms
•Low gas costs make leasing viable at smaller transaction sizes — opening the market to SMBs and individual developers
•A single well-positioned parent name can issue hundreds of subdomains, turning one name into a recurring revenue platform
•Names that score 7 or higher on the scoring framework become subdomain infrastructure plays, not just individual names


**What Makes a Name Valuable for Leasing**
When evaluating any name, the core questions are always the same:

•What does this name enable? What does it do?Function: 
•Does it define or anchor an entire vertical?Category control: 
•Would a serious business pay to lease this identity?Enterprise relevance: 
•Is this a namespace developers actually need?Developer demand: 
•Can this name power real systems at scale?Infrastructure potential: 
•What is the realistic multi-year leasing revenue?Commercial value: 

A name like orchestrator.eth or national-id.eth is not valuable because it is rare — it is valuable because it defines infrastructure that protocols, enterprises, and governments actually need. Rarity without function is trivia. Function without rarity is a commodity. The most valuable names are both.

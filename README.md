### How to Use This Guide

Pricing an ENS name is not guesswork — it follows a logic based on what the name does, who needs it, and how much leverage it gives the person who controls it. This guide gives you a practical decision framework first, then the complete pricing chart. Work through the questions in order and you will land in the right tier every time.

---

### Step 1 — Ask These 5 Questions

Before you look at any price range, answer these five questions about the name. Each one adds or removes value. Be honest — the market will be.

| # | Question | YES means... | NO means... |
|---|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **1** | **Does this name define a category or vertical?** | ✅ YES → Start at $9k+ list. This name IS the infrastructure. | ❌ NO → Start lower. It supports something, it doesn't define it. |
| **2** | **Would a serious enterprise or protocol pay to own this identity?** | ✅ YES → Add commercial premium. Move up at least one tier. | ❌ NO → Keep it in the utility range. It has use but not enterprise pull. |
| **3** | **Can this name power subdomains at scale?** | ✅ YES → Lease value multiplies. Flag it as a subdomain platform play. | ❌ NO → Value is in the name itself only. Price on direct use. |
| **4** | **Is this name tied to an active or emerging narrative (AI, ZK, RWA, ENSv2)?** | ✅ YES → Add narrative premium. Hot narratives move faster and higher. | ❌ NO → Stable pricing. Good utility names hold value regardless. |
| **5** | **Could someone replace this name with something else and lose nothing?** | ✅ YES → It is replaceable. Do not overprice it. | ❌ NO → It is irreplaceable. Price it accordingly. |

---

### Step 2 — Score the Name

After answering the five questions, give the name a score from 1 to 10 using the table below. This score maps directly to the pricing tier in Step 3.

| Score | What this name is |
|-------|------------------|
| **1–2** | Novelty or experimental. No real commercial use case. Hard to explain why someone would lease it. |
| **3–4** | Useful tool or service name. Has a real function but doesn't define a category or control a vertical. |
| **5–6** | Solid utility name. Works for a product, protocol, or platform. Has commercial application in one vertical. |
| **7–8** | Premium multi-vertical or category-adjacent name. Serious builders would want this. Strong subdomain potential. |
| **9** | Category-defining name. This IS the default name for something important. Enterprise and protocol grade. |
| **10** | Top 1% infrastructure primitive. Irreplaceable. Defines the entire vertical. Examples: orchestrator, aggregator, executor, gateway, national-id. |

---

### Step 3 — Apply the Pricing Chart

Match your score to the list price range and annual lease. These ranges reflect the real commercial value of the name, not just its novelty. The lease price is the annual rate for a subdomain or name lease. The list price is the outright sale price in ETH equivalent.

| List Price (ETH) | Annual Lease | Strategic Value & Use Case |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| 0.00 – 0.49 | $50/year | Utility with no strategic leverage. Tools, novelty names, experimental concepts. They don't control or define anything. |
| 0.50 – 0.99 | $100/year | Business-level utility. Supports a product, service, or small brand. SMB tools, service names, mid-tier suites. Commercial use but doesn't define a category. |
| 1.00 – 1.99 | $200/year | Foundational infrastructure. Anchors a product or protocol. Validators, networks, AI platforms, DeFi primitives. The base layer of a system. |
| 2.00 – 2.99 | $300/year | Protocol-level infrastructure. Powers agents, registries, or network utilities. Enables multi-user or multi-system functionality. |
| 3.00 – 3.99 | $400/year | Registry-grade names. Can define a category or index. Indices, registries, platform utilities. Can become the official source for something. |
| 4.00 – 4.99 | $500/year | Enterprise-grade platforms. Anchors a serious business or protocol. Agentic systems, enterprise platforms, DeFi infrastructure. |
| 5.00 – 5.99 | $600/year | Advanced agentic infrastructure. Powers AI systems, validators, or premium suites. Used by builders who need reliability and authority. |
| 6.00 – 6.99 | $700/year | High-value AI and agent systems. Used by serious builders. Advanced AI infrastructure, agent systems, enterprise suites. Direct commercial application. |
| 7.00 – 7.99 | $800/year | Premium mixed-vertical assets. Fits multiple high-value categories. Agents, suites, DeFi infrastructure, multi-category utilities. Broad commercial potential. |
| 8.00 – 8.99 | $900/year | Premium category infrastructure. Defines a vertical. Enterprise systems, category utilities. The default name for a category. |
| 9.00 – 9.99 | $1,000/year | Enterprise platforms and high-value suites. Advanced AI utilities, DeFi platforms, category-defining brands. Can anchor a company or protocol. |
| 10.00 – 11.99 | $1,200/year | Premium AI and DeFi infrastructure. Numeric category brands, platform utilities, enterprise systems. Long-term commercial value. |
| 12.00 – 14.99 | $1,500/year | Ecosystem-level assets. Full suites, registries, complete ecosystems. Near-monopoly positioning in a vertical. |
| 15.00+ | $2,500 – $10,000+/year | Top 1% — Category monopolies and primitives. Orchestrator, router, aggregator, executor, compliance and identity primitives. Irreplaceable. They define the entire vertical. They are infrastructure. |

### What ENSv2 Changes About Subdomain Leasing

#### The Story: Why ENSv2 Stays on Layer 1

When ENS first announced ENSv2 in late 2024, the plan was to move to a dedicated Layer 2 chain called **Namechain** — purpose-built to handle the gas costs of registering and managing millions of .eth names. At the time, registering an ENS name on Ethereum mainnet could cost nearly $5 in gas fees. Building a separate L2 seemed like the only way to make subdomain leasing economically viable at scale.

That calculus changed completely in 2025.

Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade doubled the gas limit from 30 million to 60 million — and core developers are now targeting 200 million by 2026. The result: <strong>ENS registration gas costs fell 99% in a single year</strong>, dropping from ~$5 to under $0.05 per name. ENS lead developer nick.eth ran the numbers and found that subsidizing every ENS transaction in all of 2025 would cost roughly $10,000 at current prices — and even under peak post-Fusaka congestion, just $250,000. Running a dedicated L2 like Namechain would cost substantially more than that.

On February 6, 2026, ENS officially announced: **Namechain is canceled. ENSv2 deploys exclusively on Ethereum Layer 1.**

> *"Ethereum L1 is scaling, and it's scaling faster than almost anyone predicted two years ago. By staying on L1, we're aligning ENS with the strongest possible infrastructure guarantees — Ethereum itself."*
> — nick.eth, ENS Lead Developer

This is not a retreat. It is a strategic upgrade. ENS co-founder Nick Johnson noted that ENSv2 was designed from the beginning to work on either L1 or L2 — so the core architecture, the new registry system, improved ownership models, and better name expiration handling all ship as planned. The only thing that changed is where it runs.

---

#### What This Means for the ENS Ecosystem

**For users:** No more bridging. No separate wallet. No cross-chain complexity. Everything happens on Ethereum — the chain users already know, with the security model they already trust.

**For developers:** A single canonical registry. No CCIP-Read gateways to depend on. No external infrastructure that can fail or become a bottleneck. Simpler, more reliable integrations.

**For L2s:** ENSv2 still supports resolution across 60+ blockchains including Bitcoin and Solana. The new registration flow abstracts cross-chain complexity, so you can register a .eth name from any EVM chain without manual bridging. ENS stays multi-chain compatible — it just lives on L1.

**For the broader Ethereum narrative:** This is a signal. When one of Web3's most widely adopted protocols with 2.2+ million registered names chooses L1 over its own L2, it tells the market that Ethereum's base layer is becoming viable for applications that were previously priced out. Nick Johnson also predicted the L2 space itself will contract — splitting between commodity rollups competing on fees and more specialized chains with fundamentally different execution models.

---

#### What This Means for This Portfolio

The economics that made subdomain leasing a long-term play are now immediate:

- **Gas costs are not a barrier.** At under $0.05 per registration, leasing subdomains to SMBs and individual developers is viable today — not someday after an L2 launches
- **Each .eth name gets its own smart contract registry** — true subdomain ownership with flexible, programmable terms per name
- **A single well-positioned parent name can issue hundreds of subdomains**, turning one asset into a recurring revenue platform
- **Maximum security** — subdomain leases inherit Ethereum's full proof-of-stake security model, not a rollup's trust assumptions
- **No dependency on gateway infrastructure** — names resolve directly on L1, no external services required
- **Names scoring 7+ on the pricing framework** are subdomain infrastructure plays right now, not theoretical future plays

The window between now and ENSv2 going fully live is the best time to position. The infrastructure is proven. The costs are solved. The only remaining question is who builds on top of it first.

### What Makes a Name Valuable for Leasing

When evaluating any name, the core questions are always the same:

- **Function:** What does this name enable? What does it do?
- **Category control:** Does it define or anchor an entire vertical?
- **Enterprise relevance:** Would a serious business pay to lease this identity?
- **Developer demand:** Is this a namespace developers actually need?
- **Infrastructure potential:** Can this name power real systems at scale?
- **Commercial value:** What is the realistic multi-year leasing revenue?

> *A name like orchestrator.eth or national-id.eth is not valuable because it is rare — it is valuable because it defines infrastructure that protocols, enterprises, and governments actually need. Rarity without function is trivia. Function without rarity is a commodity. The most valuable names are both.*
